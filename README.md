This code will give you the structure to find Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient between two sets of discrete measures.
This code will also plot the mean of measurements and difference of measurements on a scatter plot with upper and lower limits of agreement and their confidence intervals on each filled in to make a modified Bland Altman Plot.
